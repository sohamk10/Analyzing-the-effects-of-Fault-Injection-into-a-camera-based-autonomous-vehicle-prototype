# Fault-Injection-In-Autonomous-Vehicle.
Identifying failure modes of vehicle cameras in the domain of autonomous driving (ADAS) and, designing a Fault Injection Module (FIM) to inject these faults through image processing into the autonomous vehicle system.  Compassion between the faults to validate the robustness of an autonomous vehicle system.
