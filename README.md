# Fault-Injection-In-Autonomous-Vehicle.
Identifying failure modes of vehicle cameras in the domain of autonomous driving (ADAS) and, designing a Fault Injection Module (FIM) to inject these faults through image processing into the autonomous vehicle system.  

This task consists of identifying various failure modes associated with vehicle cameras. The following faults were selected for further study based on literature review and research: Pixel manipulation faults, image superimposition faults, and new filters to simulate rainy weather. As a result, the following faults have been implemented:

1. Contrast  
2. Brightness  
3. Blur Colour  
4. Sharpness  
5. Raindrop  
6. Blur  
7. Salt and Pepper noise  
8. Snow  
9. Dust  
10. Rain  
11. Dense fog  
12. Light fog  
13. Mud splash  
14. Glass crack  
15. Shattered glass  
16. Smog  
17. Dust
